</pre>
**NOTE: I CAN NOT SHARE THE NAME OF THE WEBSITE**

IF YOU WANT JSON OR EXCEL SHEET, CONTACT ME :)<br/>
THIS SCRIPT IS CAPABLE TO GET DATA FOR ANY CITY. [INDIA ONLY]

## FILE:- 1. CityCompaniesExcelScript.py
* Fetch the data from 'website_name' website.
* I invested a lot of time to find the main data source on "website_name"
* I found pattern in the data source (JSON file) which called multiple times within which multiple URLs were called too
    from which i got chunks of data. [CONTAINS A LOT DATA OUT OF WHICH I USED ONLY FEW]
* Then I cleaned all the data and I decided what should I keep and what I should not. [TEDIOUS TASK]
* Below is the code. It calls multiple URLs one by one, get required data by parsing and then make an Excel structure out of it.
    
### Summarizing....
1. Got a data source (JSON form), called multiple URLS by analyzaing the JSON form, 
2. From multiple URLs, I got a chunks of data after which I created a simple excel structure.
3. You can contact me on linkedIn if you want this data either in Excel or JSON.
